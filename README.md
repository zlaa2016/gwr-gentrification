# Starbucks Locations & Gentrification via Geographically Informed Models
 
Code & visuals for Starbucks Locations & Gentrification project by me and 1 other collaborator; academic paper available upon request  


*Methods include:*
* Linear Regression  
* Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)  
* Simultaneous Autoregression (SAR)
* Conditional Autoregression (CAR) 
* Hypothesis testing for spatial randomness    


*Below are some of the visualizations used in the exploratory analysis and model evaluations:*
