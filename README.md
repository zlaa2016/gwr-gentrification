# Starbucks Locations & Gentrification via Geographically Informed Models
 
Code & Figures for Starbucks Locations & Gentrification project 

### *Overview*

---

Gentrification, or the movement of affluent residents and businesses into diverse,
low-income urban areas, is known to cause shortages of affordable housing, health
consequences, and cultural displacement. In this study, we examine the geographical distribution
of Starbucks, an upper-middle-class aesthetic landmark, to determine its association with
gentrification-related demographic factors. 



### *Methods include:*

---

* Linear Regression  
* Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)  
* Simultaneous Autoregression (SAR)
* Conditional Autoregression (CAR) 
* Hypothesis testing for spatial randomness    


*Below are some of the visualizations used in the exploratory analysis and model evaluations:*
